Some notes on setting this project up
=====================================

To get a deployment key for Travis, go to github, my user settings page.
Choose "Developer Settings" from the sidebar, and "Personal Access
Tokens" from there. Create a personal access token and copy the value.

To put that token securely in `.travis.yml` needs a Travis command line
client (unlike Appveyor, there doesn't seem to be a way to do this in
the web UI). For a Python user, the simplest to set up was `travis-encrypt`
which can be installed via pip:

```
pew mktmpenv
pip install travis-encrypt
```

To do the encryption:

```
travis-encrypt pfmoore builder-sed .\.travis.yml
```

This updates `.travis.yml`, and you can move the added line to where
it needs to go.
